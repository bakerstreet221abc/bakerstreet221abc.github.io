Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby is an expert on food allergies. His testimony, that the reason why a young man became murderously violent was due to a food allergy, was accepted by a UK Crown Court. The young man was released on the condition that he should follow Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby’s diet.

Recently, I have been researching and experimenting how food could help improve my health and strengthen my immune system. I have tried the plant based diet for several month, eating nothing but vegetables, juices and smoothies, until...I found I have shingles.

While it's hard to pinpoint the culprit of those annoying shingles, I suspect that's due to a lack of Lysine, based on [this post](https://www.veggieboards.com/forum/14-general-health-discussion/127682-shingles-herpes-outbreaks-what-every-vegan-should-know.html). So according to [this article](https://www.livestrong.com/article/491377-what-foods-to-avoid-during-a-shingles-outbreak/), I should add salmon, eat more avocado, and yogurt.

I thought it's perfectly safe to have a plant based diet, but apparently I was wrong. We should be cautious like the detectives are, about our diet.
