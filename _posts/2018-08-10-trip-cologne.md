Cologne is a place with rich cultural heritages, and it has been a long time since I wrote a blog about the place I travelled to. This time I really want to write something about Cologne.

## The Dom

I visited Cologne during September, 2015. When we were still kilometers away from the city, we could already see the magnificent `Kölner Dom`. It was the sole reason that I wanted to travel there, because the Dom is so high that it is "closest to God". Therefore, there is no surprise that the train station `Hauptbahnhof` besides the Dom is the station that is also "closest to God". I came to know this landmark from `World Cyber Game` once held there.

## Football

I had a very interesting experience at the bar located right opposite the Dom, called `Gaffel am Dom`. When I walked inside, I found that the place was full of football fans, who were all very excited. When I was wondering the reason of their excitedness, two of the fans approached me, and told me that Koln just won the Derby with Mönchengladbach! Being a huge football fan myself, I had no idea that there was a Bundesliga game going on right there. The friendly fans also told me the mascot of Koln, unlike that of other clubs, is a real goat, and before the game this goat will walk on the pitch. The goat soon becomes famous and is a star of the local zoo. I had a great chat with the fans since I am a football fan myself, and I support Real Madrid, instead of FC Bayern Munich (they all seemed to dislike Bayern).

## Rhine River

Besides the Dom, the Rhine River was also very beautiful. I could never be bored while walking along the river because of its beauty, which reminded me of Chang Jiang (There was a KTV with a Chinese name on the river bank, which almost made me believe that I was in China). All the unhappyness went away when I looked across the river, watching the salient flow of the water. Like the lyrics in `Comming Home`:

> Let the rain wash away
> all the pain of yesterday

I did not go into the Chocolate Museum, because the queue was too long. Instead, I visited `Wallraf-Richartz-Museum` to appreciate the impressionist paintings. There was a ongoing show about the paintings themed `The Seine`.

## Mystery

Frank Schätzing is a German writer born in Cologne, whose novels are more popular than Harry Potter in Germany. He has won the 2005 `Deutscher Krimi Preis`, which is the most prestigious prize for crime novels in Germany. His detective novels include `The Tyranny of the Butterfly` [media link](https://www.dw.com/en/best-selling-author-frank-sch%C3%A4tzing-creates-an-ai-dystopia-in-latest-thriller/a-43506188), which is set in California, involving the hottest topic nowadays: artificial intelligence.   

## Conclusion

Football, river, art, music, not to mention mystery, make Cologne such a great place. I was shocked when I heard the riot and attack happened there some time later. It is really hard to imagine such a peaceful place, full of music, art, and traditional German food, would be associated with riot and violence. I do hope that everything will be fine soon.
