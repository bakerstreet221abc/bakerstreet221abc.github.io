> Amazing grace, how sweet the sound

There is one show in Detective Conan, which is about this lovely song called Amazing Grace. That show is one of my favorite, and a cut could be found [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av8815338/?spm_id_from=333.788.videocard.2).

I remember when I was exchanged to the JC that JJ Lin attended, called Saint Adrew JC, Amazing Grace was played every morning.

Years later, after I was diagnosed with a serious disease, I have realized that it's God's grace that I should thank for.

I was totally lost previously, since I had no idea of my sin and I was always self-centered. Through the suffering, I feel that it's the God's grace that keeps me safe thus far, even during this thunderstorm in my life.

It's God's grace that taught my heart to fear, and relieved my fears.
